kobe as an investor while making a decision to invest:
1) do you understand the business
2) you can help in some form of fashion when there are barriers entry to that bisiness 
3) the entrepreneurs themselves, company themselves, 
 do they have a culture that you believe is sustainable.
4) are these leaders those type of people that you believe in. are they obsessive.
have they created a culture of obsessiveness 

in my view, these factors are important when chossing the investor as well. Choosing the investor who believes in above.

kobe on hiring:
1) we need obsessives. they must challenge themselves to do the best job that they think they can do. that's what I m there for them to constantly look in the mirror ans self assess and challenge 
2) if we have a project and you're saying ok i can do that. that's not the project we want. I want 
the projects that say i dont know if I can animate that, I dont know how to write that story.
I dont know how to do that those stuff: are the things we want in employees because through that
curiosity you'll reach a level that you didnt think was possible and so running a studio 
thats what I m doing after retirement. 


kobe wants to build animation studio:
so you got to start with the head of the snake. 
SO you need to look at the person thats better understands the type of animation 
that you want to create and they have to be obsessives, have to have knowledge base, the 
historical knowledge base of the industry. I love people that understand the history 
of their industry. know ins and out of it all. 
Then you bring that person into the picture and then you allow them to do what you 
brought them to do.Leave them all alone. 
I m not going to hire you to tell you how to do your job.
